# WobbleWatch
WobbleWatch is a prototype of an app designed to provide daily feedback to elderly users at risk of falling. 

The model at its core is based on work repoted in *A novel hybrid deep neural network to predict pre-impact fall for older people based on wearable inertial sensors* by Xiaoqun Yu, Hai Qiu and Shuping Xiong published in Frontiers in Bioenginerring and Biotechnology, February, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00063).

# Usage
To use WobbleWatch, simply open the app and connect your device.

WobbleWatch is designed as a web app for use by the general public. All of the relevant code is included here so that one could train/retrain the model and rebuild the app components.
